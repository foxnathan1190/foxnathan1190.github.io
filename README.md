<p>I have been a zookeeper for 10+ years and have learned to work on a team and thrive in that environment. Being a zookeeper has also given me a great deal of compassion and work ethic that are both integral to any career. I am currently learning coding JavaScript and Java though LaunchCode in order to break into a tech career. I have learned to overcome difficulties in coding and maintain the goal of learning new concepts to broaden my coding base. I hope to become a junior developer with senior developer on the horizon. I want to work for a quality company that values me but also shows flexibility.</p><br>

Full-Stack Brewery Explorer Application (LaunchCode Final Project)
This project is a complete, full-stack web application designed to demonstrate proficiency in modern persistence, security, and API integration.

Backend & Data Persistence: Developed a robust backend using Java Spring Boot to handle business logic, user authentication, and data transactions. Data persistence is managed via a MySQL database, utilizing a secure architecture to store and retrieve user profiles and a many-to-many relationship for saved brewery lists.

User Management: Implemented essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to securely sign in, create, and manage their personal profiles.

Interactive Frontend: Designed a modern, responsive user interface with an interactive search feature. This front-end consumes data from an extensive external API, allowing users to dynamically search for breweries by location or name.

Key Functionality: Users can save specific breweries to their profile, establishing a personalized list that persists across sessions, showcasing effective integration between the front-end display, the Spring Boot API, and the MySQL database.</p><br>
