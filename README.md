I have been a zookeeper for 10+ years and have learned to work on a team and thrive in that environment. Being a zookeeper has also given me a great deal of compassion and work ethic that are both integral to any career. I am currently learning coding JavaScript and Java though LaunchCode in order to break into a tech career. I have learned to overcome difficulties in coding and maintain the goal of learning new concepts to broaden my coding base. I hope to become a junior developer with senior developer on the horizon. I want to work for a quality company that values me but also shows flexibility.
